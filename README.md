- **SAN DIEGO PERSONAL INJURY LAW FIRM | JASSIM LAW**
- _MAKING OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER_
- "Jassim Law was founded by attorney Pajman Jassim, as a law firm focusing on personal injury, employment litigation and trial practice. We only represent people – we do not represent insurance companies, corporations, or government entities.

We do not work on volume – which means we are also selective about the cases we accept. You deserve an attorney that is the right fit for you and your family. The result is once we have accepted representation, we are prepared to go all the way… with your best interests always our top priority.

We have successfully tried, arbitrated, mediated, and settled many significant cases throughout California. Our work throughout California has helped countless individuals and their families recover for the harms and losses they have suffered because of the wrongdoing, negligence, or intentional conduct of others."
